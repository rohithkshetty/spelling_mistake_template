Double Letter Confussion</h3> <p> Many words containing double letters is frequently mispelled because people forget witch letter should be doubled.

'IE' vs 'EI' Confussion</h3> <p> The rule "i before e except after c" dont allways apply, wich leads to frequent mistakes. Words like "recieve", "beleive", and "wierd" are often mispelled. </p> <div class="tip"> <strong>Helpfull Tip:</strong> Remember the rhyme: "I before E, except after C, or when sounding like 'ay' as in neighbor and weigh." However, their is many exceptions to this rule, such as "weird", "seize", and "neither". </div> <h3>3. Silent Letter Confussion</h3> <p> English has many words with silent letters that can lead to mispellings. These include "knot" (silent k), "writting" (should be "writing"), and "lisence" (should be "license"). </p> <blockquote> "The English language is notoriusly difficult because of it's many irregularities and exceptions. Even native speakers struggle with certain spellings threw out there lifes." </blockquote> <h3>4. Homophones Confussion</h3> <p> Homophones is words that sound the same but have different spellings and meanings. Common examples includes: </p> <ul> <li><strong>their/there/they're</strong> - "Their going to there house, and there happy about it."</li> <li><strong>your/you're</strong> - "Your the best friend I could ask for."</li> <li><strong>its/it's</strong> - "The dog wagged it's tail."</li> <li><strong>affect/effect</strong> - "The weather will effect our plans."</li> <li><strong>then/than</strong> - "I'd rather go now then later."</li> </ul> </section> <section id="examples"> <h2>Real-World Exampels</h2> <h3>Bussiness Writing</h3> <p> In proffesional communications, spelling errors can have serious concequences.
